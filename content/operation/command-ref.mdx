    Return %: -0.0092 %
```

** How It Works **

The `history` command in Hummingbot will show the current session's past trades, inventory, duration, market trading pair performance, and return percentage.

** Trade Value Delta **

Total Trade Value Delta is calculated as the difference between the total assets acquired and total assets spent, specified in quote value.

$trade\_value\_delta = (acquired - spent)$

To get the quote value of base asset (acquired or spent), multiply the base value to end price.

```
Inventory:
       Market  Asset   Starting   Current  Net Delta  Trade Delta
  0   binance    ETH    10.0000   12.0000     2.0000       1.9970
  1   binance   USDT  1000.0000  169.2100  -830.7900    -831.2056

Markets:
       Market     Pair  Start Price    End Price  Trades   Trade Value Delta
  0   binance  ETHUSDT     415.0885 415.99000000       4    -0.47352040 USDT
```

After executing these trades we acquired **1.9970 ETH** equivalent to 830.73 USDT `(1.9970 ETH * 415.99)` and spent **831.2056 USDT** tokens.

```
Trade Value Delta = (830.73 USDT - 831.2056 USDT)
Trade Value Delta = -0.47357
```

** Return Percentage **

Return is calculated based on assets spent and acquired during trades, i.e. balance changes due to the inventory like deposits, withdrawals, and manual trades outside of Hummingbot do not affect the calculation.

$Return % = trade\_value\_delta / starting\_quote\_value$

```
Inventory:
       Market  Asset   Starting   Current  Net Delta Trade Delta
  0   binance    ETH    10.0000   12.0000     2.0000      1.9970
  1   binance   USDT  1000.0000  169.2100  -830.7900   -831.2056

Markets:
       Market     Pair  Start Price    End Price Trades  Trade Value Delta
  0   binance  ETHUSDT     415.0885 415.99000000      4   -0.47352040 USDT
```

Using the same example, get the starting quote value. Convert the starting ETH amount to USDT by multiplying to the start price and add the amount of quote assets. So we started with 4,150.89 USDT worth of ETH `(10 ETH * 415.0885)` and 1000 USDT total of **5,150.89 USDT**.

```
 Return%: -0.4735204 USDT / 5150.89 USDT
 Return %: -0.0092 %
```

Using the same example, after executing these trades we can calculate Net Delta for base and quote assets, so Net Delta for base asset is **2.0000** because we started with `10.0000 ETH` and the current is `12.000 ETH`. Net Delta for quote asset is **-830.79 USDT** because we started with `1000.0000 USDT` and current is `169.21 USDT`, it means we lost **-830.79 USDT** on quote asset.

## exit

Exit and cancel all outstanding orders. This cancels all active and hanging orders.

```
>>>  exit

Winding down...

All outstanding orders cancelled.
```

#### exit -f

Force exit and cancel all outstanding orders.

```
>>>  exit -f
```

## paper_trade

Toggle paper trade mode on and off. When paper trade mode is enabled, all orders are simulated and no real orders are placed.

This feature allows users to test Hummingbot and simulate trading strategies without risking any actual assets. Enter the command `paper_trade` to enable this feature.

<!--
```
>>>  paper_trade

Enable paper trading mode (Yes/No) ? >>> Yes

New configuration saved:
paper_trade_enabled: True
```
-->

** Enabling and Disabling **

Paper trading mode can be enabled/disabled inside Hummingbot by doing `paper_trade` or `config paper_trade_enabled`.

Alternatively, you can edit the `conf_global.yml` file using a text editor and set `paper_trade_enabled:` value to `true` or `false`.

** Account Balance **

By default, the paper trade account has the following tokens and balances:

```
paper_trade_account_balance:
  BTC: 1

  TUSD: 1000
  ETH: 10
  WETH: 10

Paper trade assets can be added in two ways:

1. Run `balance paper [asset] [amount]`. See more information in [balance](/operation/command-ref/#balance) command.
2. Edit `conf_global.yml` in the `/conf` or `hummingbot_conf` folder using a text editor. **Strictly follow the same format above**.

> **Note:**

- When making changes to the global config file, make sure to exit and restart Hummingbot to take effect.

By default, the `order_book` command shows only the maker market in cross-exchange strategy or primary market when using arbitrage.

Optional arguments `--exchange` and `--market` allows you to check the order book of the taker market or secondary market.

Sample usage:

```
>>>  order_book --exchange kucoin --market ETH-USDT
  market: kucoin ETH-USDT

     bid_price  bid_volume  ask_price  ask_volume
         395.8        1.07     395.81        2.02
        395.79    22.95406     395.82   0.0505293
        395.77    7.668467     395.84    0.554996
        395.75        0.05     395.85    3.644207
         395.7           1     395.86       1.825
```

## kill switch

Automatically stops the bot when it reaches a certain performance threshold, which can be either positive or negative. This feature uses the same performance calculation methodology as the [history](/operation/command-ref#history) command.

```
Would you like to enable the kill switch? (Yes/No) >>>
At what profit/loss rate would you like the bot to stop? (e.g. -5 equals 5 percent loss) >>>
```

You can always reconfigure this feature in two ways:

1. Inside Hummingbot run command `config kill_switch_enabled` and/or `config kill_switch_rate`.
2. Edit `conf_global.yml` file using a text editor.

Note that when the market prices changes, so does the bot's performance and may trigger the kill switch. For example, we executed 13 trades and our performance are shown below.

```json
- kill_switch_enabled: True
- kill_switch_rate: -0.3
```

```
Inventory:
      Market Asset  Starting   Current  Net Delta Trade Delta
  0  binance   ETH   10.0000   11.0000     1.0000      3.0000
  1  binance  USDT  500.0000  297.1580  -202.8420   -610.6340

Markets:
      Market     Pair Start Price       End Price  Trades Trade Value Delta
  0  binance  ETHUSDT     203.913  202.7150000000      13  -2.48900000 USDT

  Duration: 0 days 00:07:06
  Total Trade Value Delta: -2.489 USDT
  Return %: -0.0985 %
```

After a while, the end price changed from 202.715 to 200.54 and so did our bot's performance even without making more trades. Since `kill_switch_rate` is set to `-0.3` this will stop the strategy.

```
Inventory:

## ticker

Displays market ticker prices such as best bid, best ask, mid price and last trade price. By default, it runs the output 10 times with 1 second in between intervals.

When optional arguments are not used i.e. running `ticker` alone displays the output from the **maker market** of a cross-exchange strategy or **primary market** when using arbitrage.

> **Note:** This command will only work while a strategy is running.

**Optional arguments**

| Command Argument | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--repeat`       | To specify the number of times the output quote is displayed |
| `--exchange`     | The specific exchange of the market                          |
| `--market`       | The market trading pair of the order book                    |

**Sample usage**

When running a cross-exchange or arbitrage strategy, you can specify which exchange and market you can display.

```
>>>  ticker --repeat 3 --exchange binance --market ETH-USDT

   Best Bid  Best Ask  Mid Price  Last Trade
   351.41    351.42    351.415      351.42

   351.41    351.42    351.415      351.42
